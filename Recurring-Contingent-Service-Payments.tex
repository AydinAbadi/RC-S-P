\section{Recurring Contingent Service Payment (RC-S-P) Protocol}

In this section, we present RC-S-P Protocol. As we explained in Section \ref{sec::Overview-of-Our-Solution}, the protocol relies on the idea that the server and client can efficiently agree on private statements at the begging of the protocol. Therefore, in the following, we first present a protocol (called SAP) that satisfies that requirements and then present RC-S-P Protocol.
