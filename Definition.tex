\section{Definitions}\label{Definition}

In this section, first we present a generic formal definition of a verifiable service (VS) scheme. Second, we provide a formal definition of an enhanced VS scheme that  allows: (a) either party to be malicious and (b) a trusted third-party arbiter, to identify a corrupt party. We call the  scheme that offers the above features verifiable service with identifiable abort (VSID).   Third, we present a formal definition of an upgraded VSID scheme that  addresses   the issues we identified in Section \ref{sec::previous-work-limitations}, i.e. wasting server's resources and real-time leakage of service input and proof's status.  We call the latter scheme recurring contingent service payment (RC-S-P).
